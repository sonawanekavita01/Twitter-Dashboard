**Twitter Analytics Dashboard Report**

**1.	Introduction**

This report explores key engagement metrics for tweets, aiming to identify patterns and strategies to optimize social media performance. The analysis focuses on metrics such as retweets, likes, impressions, app opens, and engagement rate comparisons.

**2. Background**

The analysis evaluates tweet performance by applying specific filters, including posting times, days of the week, dates, engagement rates, and the impact of app opens. The goal is to uncover actionable insights that enhance engagement on Twitter.

**3. Learning Objectives**

Identify tweets with the highest engagement (calculated as the sum of retweets and likes).Compare engagement metrics for tweets posted with app opens versus those without.Highlight tweets in the top 10% based on engagement rates.


**4.	Activities and Tasks**

To achieve the objectives, the following steps were undertaken:

**•	Data Filtering and Preparation:**

Filters were applied in Power BI to sort tweets based on various criteria, such as time of day, odd/even dates, impressions, weekdays vs. weekends, word count, and specific time-based visibility conditions. Only tweets that met these criteria were included in the analysis.

**•	Visualization Development:**

Top 10% Engagement Rate Tweets:
A chart was created to display tweets in the top 10% of engagement rates. These tweets had over 50 likes, were posted on weekdays, and adhered to word count and time-based visibility conditions.

**• Top 10 Tweets by Retweets and Likes:**

A chart showcasing the tweets with the highest sum of retweets and likes for weekend posts was developed. Tweets were filtered by criteria like word count, even impressions, odd dates, and specific time-based visibility settings. Due to the lack of user profile data, tweet IDs were used in the legend for representation.

**• Engagement Comparison (App Opens vs. No App Opens):**

A comparison chart was built to analyze engagement rates for tweets with and without app opens, focusing on weekday posts made between 9 AM and 5 PM. Filters included word count, impressions, and date. Since no tweets with app opens met the specified criteria, the comparison focused solely on tweets without app opens. Summary cards were added to display app open counts and highlight tweets meeting or missing the conditions.

**• Additional  Visuals:**

Twelve visuals were developed in Power BI, covering metrics such as hashtag clicks, URL clicks, user profile interactions, likes, retweets, weekly tweet counts, media views, impressions, and engagement rates. These provided a comprehensive view of tweet performance.

**•	Data Analysis:**

Engagement patterns were analyzed across all charts to identify trends, make comparisons, and recommend best practices for tweet timing and content optimization.


**5.	Skills and Competencies**

This project enhanced skills in data filtering, Power BI visualization, and analytical interpretation to provide actionable insights for improving tweet engagement.

**6.	Feedback and Evidence**

Feedback emphasized the importance of designing engagement strategies tailored to tweet timing, word count, and interaction types. The Power BI visuals provided strong evidence for identifying high-performing tweets.

**7.	Challenges and Solutions**

•	Challenges:
  Managing complex filtering criteria and time-based visibility conditions.Dynamically calculating engagement rate percentiles for identifying top-performing tweets.
	
•	Solutions:
	Introduced intermediate filters for primary criteria (e.g., weekday filtering) before applying detailed filters.Used the PERCENTILE.INC function in Power BI to dynamically calculate percentiles for engagement rate analysis.


**8.	Outcomes and Impact**

The analysis revealed actionable insights to enhance social media strategies. A key finding showed that tweets with fewer than 30 words tend to achieve higher engagement, offering guidance for future content planning.

**8. Conclusion**

This report provides insights into the optimal timing, content structure, and app opens' role in maximizing tweet engagement. Encouraging app opens is recommended to drive improved interaction rates.
